I created a bot that uses a weighted algorithm to solve Wordle. The approach is based on analyzing the frequency of characters in each column of possible answers and searching for a word with the highest weighted score

Against previous Wordle answers, the bot was able to solve the puzzle in under 3 times almost 50% of the time!

To run, navigate to the file `testalgorithm.py` and run it
